# MapDB 

### 介绍

MapDB provides Java Maps, Sets, Lists, Queues and other collections backed by off-heap or on-disk storage. It is a hybrid between java collection framework and embedded database engine. It is free and open-source under Apache license.  

MapDB combines embedded database engine and Java collections. It is free under Apache 2 license. MapDB is flexible and can be used in many roles:

* Drop-in replacement for Maps, Lists, Queues and other collections.
* Off-heap collections not affected by Garbage Collector
* Multilevel cache with expiration and disk overflow.
* RDBMs replacement with transactions, MVCC, incremental backups etc…
* Local data processing and filtering. MapDB has utilities to process huge quantities of data in reasonable time.
